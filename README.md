# Classification Algorithms

## Overview
This project explores various classification algorithms for predicting strokes based on health-related features. The dataset used contains information about individuals' demographics, lifestyle, and medical history, with the target variable indicating whether or not they have experienced a stroke. The goal is to build and compare different machine learning models to predict strokes accurately.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is stored in the file `brain_stroke.csv`. It contains the following columns:
- `gender`: Gender of the individual
- `age`: Age of the individual
- `hypertension`: Whether the individual has hypertension (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- `heart_disease`: Whether the individual has heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- `ever_married`: Whether the individual is married (Yes/No)
- `work_type`: Type of work the individual is engaged in
- `Residence_type`: Type of residence (Urban/Rural)
- `avg_glucose_level`: Average glucose level in the blood
- `bmi`: Body mass index (BMI) of the individual
- `smoking_status`: Smoking status of the individual
- `stroke`: Target variable indicating whether the individual has experienced a stroke (1 = yes, 0 = no)

## Algorithms Used
The following classification algorithms are explored in this project:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Bernoulli Naive Bayes
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes
6. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
